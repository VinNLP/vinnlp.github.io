5/15/2025,Prof. Musatafa Jarrar,Birzeit University / Hamad Bin Khalifa University,Palestine / Qatar,https://www.jarrar.info/,https://www.jarrar.info/Photos/photo.jpg,NLP Tools and Datasets for Low-Resource Languages: The Case of Arabic,This talk will explore effective strategies for developing NLP tools and datasets for low-resource languages; using Arabic as a case study. It will highlight key resources; including Wordnets and linguistic ontologies; NLP lexicons; annotated corpora; LLMs instruction datasets; image captioning; morphological analysis; word sense disambiguation; named entity recognition; hate speech detection; and methods for bias and propaganda detection. Open-source toolkits supporting Arabic NLP will also be presented. No prior background in Arabic or NLP is required.,,https://events.teams.microsoft.com/event/84914942-9dd3-4153-bdac-4b94be5ae548@58f82789-6695-4f4a-abdb-357668d55cff
5/29/2025,Dr. Nguyen Cam Tu,Nanjing University,China,https://ai.nju.edu.cn/CamTuNguyen/,talks\MinhNguyen.jpeg,Advances in Offline Reinforcement Learning with Human Feedback (RLHF) for Language Model Alignment,Reinforcement Learning with Human Feedback (RLHF) has become a key approach for aligning large language models (LLMs) with human preferences; however; online RLHF methods often introduce significant complexity; computational overhead; and instability during training. Recently; offline RLHF approaches have emerged as a promising alternative; offering enhanced efficiency by learning directly from fixed preference datasets. This lecture will provide a comprehensive overview of recent advancements in offline RLHF methodologies; we will explore the evolution of offline RLHF; discussing methods such as SLiC-HF; RRHF; PRO; and the widely adopted Direct Preference Optimization (DPO) framework. Building on DPO; we will examine several enhancements including IPO; Token-DPO; DPOP; and others that aim to improve generalisation; stability; and fine-grained preference alignment. Finally; we will tackle the challenges posed by noisy preference data and review various strategies designed to address these issues.,,https://events.teams.microsoft.com/event/3dc8962a-8bd3-42bf-9642-06bd324bf04d@58f82789-6695-4f4a-abdb-357668d55cff

This talk explores advancements in neuro-symbolic world models for NLP through causal discovery; social simulation; and equation learning; emphasizing methods to mitigate spurious correlations; enhance robustness and performance in low-resource settings. We first examine techniques employing causal discovery algorithms to address spurious correlations in open-domain dialogue systems. These methods identify direct causal relationships within conversation histories; yielding more relevant and informative responses. Building upon these insights; we introduce CausalScore; an automatic; reference-free metric that assesses response relevance using causal principles; removing reliance on predefined references. Next; we discuss the factors influencing the capabilities of Large Language Models (LLMs) on causal discovery and present a novel algorithm combining the strengths of causal models and LLMs. We also introduce ACCESS; a benchmark designed specifically for causal reasoning over abstract events. Additionally; we introduce SurveyPilot; an agent-based framework utilizing LLMs for automated human opinion collection via social media. In negotiation dialogue contexts; we highlight socially-aware assistive LLM agents employing a novel In-Context Learning method to remediate norm violations. We further present RENOVI; a socio-cultural benchmark for identifying and remediating norm violations; encompassing annotated dialogues to enhance interactive AI systems' cultural sensitivity. Finally; we discuss our novel approach integrating symbolic regression and trajectory-guided image-to-video models; effectively addressing video generation models' shortcomings in accurately reproducing real-world physics. Our method successfully discovers equations of motion from video trajectories; significantly improving the physical alignment of forecasts without additional fine-tuning; as demonstrated in classical mechanics scenarios. Together; these advancements contribute significantly towards developing robust; adaptable; and physically-grounded neuro-symbolic world models capable of reasoning and interaction in complex; dynamic environments.,,https://events.teams.microsoft.com/event/6bcad7b3-211d-4d46-a4ad-9ad6dac08bcb@58f82789-6695-4f4a-abdb-357668d55cff
