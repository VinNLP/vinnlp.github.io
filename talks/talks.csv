5/15/2025,Prof. Musatafa Jarrar,Birzeit University / Hamad Bin Khalifa University,Palestine / Qatar,https://www.jarrar.info/,https://www.jarrar.info/Photos/photo.jpg,NLP Tools and Datasets for Low-Resource Languages: The Case of Arabic,This talk will explore effective strategies for developing NLP tools and datasets for low-resource languages; using Arabic as a case study. It will highlight key resources; including Wordnets and linguistic ontologies; NLP lexicons; annotated corpora; LLMs instruction datasets; image captioning; morphological analysis; word sense disambiguation; named entity recognition; hate speech detection; and methods for bias and propaganda detection. Open-source toolkits supporting Arabic NLP will also be presented. No prior background in Arabic or NLP is required.,,https://forms.office.com/r/Cq0sZgbq66
5/29/2025,Dr. Nguyen Cam Tu,Nanjing University,China,https://ai.nju.edu.cn/CamTuNguyen/,https://ai.nju.edu.cn/CamTuNguyen/assets/images/profile.jpg,Advances in Offline Reinforcement Learning with Human Feedback (RLHF) for Language Model Alignment,"Reinforcement Learning with Human Feedback (RLHF) has become a key approach for aligning large language models (LLMs) with human preferences; however, online RLHF methods often introduce significant complexity; computational overhead; and instability during training. Recently, offline RLHF approaches have emerged as a promising alternative; offering enhanced efficiency by learning directly from fixed preference datasets.
This lecture will provide a comprehensive overview of recent advancements in offline RLHF methodologies; we will explore the evolution of offline RLHF; discussing methods such as SLiC-HF; RRHF; PRO; and the widely adopted Direct Preference Optimization (DPO) framework. Building on DPO; we will examine several enhancements—including IPO; Token-DPO; DPOP; and others—that aim to improve generalisation; stability; and fine-grained preference alignment. Finally; we will tackle the challenges posed by noisy preference data and review various strategies designed to address these issues.",,
