5/15/2025,Prof. Musatafa Jarrar,Birzeit University / Hamad Bin Khalifa University,Palestine / Qatar,https://www.jarrar.info/,https://www.jarrar.info/Photos/photo.jpg,NLP Tools and Datasets for Low-Resource Languages: The Case of Arabic,This talk will explore effective strategies for developing NLP tools and datasets for low-resource languages; using Arabic as a case study. It will highlight key resources; including Wordnets and linguistic ontologies; NLP lexicons; annotated corpora; LLMs instruction datasets; image captioning; morphological analysis; word sense disambiguation; named entity recognition; hate speech detection; and methods for bias and propaganda detection. Open-source toolkits supporting Arabic NLP will also be presented. No prior background in Arabic or NLP is required.,,https://events.teams.microsoft.com/event/84914942-9dd3-4153-bdac-4b94be5ae548@58f82789-6695-4f4a-abdb-357668d55cff
5/29/2025,Dr. Nguyen Cam Tu,Nanjing University,China,https://ai.nju.edu.cn/CamTuNguyen/,talks\MinhNguyen.jpeg,Advances in Offline Reinforcement Learning with Human Feedback (RLHF) for Language Model Alignment,Reinforcement Learning with Human Feedback (RLHF) has become a key approach for aligning large language models (LLMs) with human preferences; however; online RLHF methods often introduce significant complexity; computational overhead; and instability during training. Recently; offline RLHF approaches have emerged as a promising alternative; offering enhanced efficiency by learning directly from fixed preference datasets. This lecture will provide a comprehensive overview of recent advancements in offline RLHF methodologies; we will explore the evolution of offline RLHF; discussing methods such as SLiC-HF; RRHF; PRO; and the widely adopted Direct Preference Optimization (DPO) framework. Building on DPO; we will examine several enhancements including IPO; Token-DPO; DPOP; and others that aim to improve generalisation; stability; and fine-grained preference alignment. Finally; we will tackle the challenges posed by noisy preference data and review various strategies designed to address these issues.,,https://events.teams.microsoft.com/event/3dc8962a-8bd3-42bf-9642-06bd324bf04d@58f82789-6695-4f4a-abdb-357668d55cff

This talk explores advancements in neuro-symbolic world models for NLP through causal discovery; social simulation; and equation learning; emphasizing methods to mitigate spurious correlations; enhance robustness and performance in low-resource settings. We first examine techniques employing causal discovery algorithms to address spurious correlations in open-domain dialogue systems. These methods identify direct causal relationships within conversation histories; yielding more relevant and informative responses. Building upon these insights; we introduce CausalScore; an automatic; reference-free metric that assesses response relevance using causal principles; removing reliance on predefined references. Next; we discuss the factors influencing the capabilities of Large Language Models (LLMs) on causal discovery and present a novel algorithm combining the strengths of causal models and LLMs. We also introduce ACCESS; a benchmark designed specifically for causal reasoning over abstract events. Additionally; we introduce SurveyPilot; an agent-based framework utilizing LLMs for automated human opinion collection via social media. In negotiation dialogue contexts; we highlight socially-aware assistive LLM agents employing a novel In-Context Learning method to remediate norm violations. We further present RENOVI; a socio-cultural benchmark for identifying and remediating norm violations; encompassing annotated dialogues to enhance interactive AI systems' cultural sensitivity. Finally; we discuss our novel approach integrating symbolic regression and trajectory-guided image-to-video models; effectively addressing video generation models' shortcomings in accurately reproducing real-world physics. Our method successfully discovers equations of motion from video trajectories; significantly improving the physical alignment of forecasts without additional fine-tuning; as demonstrated in classical mechanics scenarios. Together; these advancements contribute significantly towards developing robust; adaptable; and physically-grounded neuro-symbolic world models capable of reasoning and interaction in complex; dynamic environments.,,https://events.teams.microsoft.com/event/6bcad7b3-211d-4d46-a4ad-9ad6dac08bcb@58f82789-6695-4f4a-abdb-357668d55cff
6/12/2025,Prof. Dawn Knight,Cardiff University,United Kingdom,https://profiles.cardiff.ac.uk/staff/knightd5,https://profiles-cardiff.imgix.net/attachments/1792?w=200&h=200&auto=format&crop=faces&fit=crop&q=90%22,Corpus Linguistics and NLP for Minoritised Languages: A Welsh Language Case Study,The creation of language technology resources in a minoritised language context; such as the Welsh language; poses interesting challenges; but also presents opportunities that are not always available to developers of such resources for larger languages. In this presentation I will demonstrate how scrutiny of the unique context of a specific minoritised language; and meaningful collaboration with potential user groups; can determine the design and construction of language resources. The talk showcases recent developments in the creation of digital resources for Welsh. This showcase will include a discussion of some of our own interdisciplinary and cross-institutional projects including CorCenCC corpus (the National Corpus of Contemporary Welsh: www.corcencc.org); Thesawrws; FreeTxt (a bilingual toolkit that supports the analysis and visualisation of free text data) and GDC-WDG (an online collection of freely available digital resources designed to support the exploration; analysis; learning; and referencing of the Welsh language). The creation of these resources involved the development of important new tools and processes; including; in the case of CorCenCC; a unique user-driven corpus design in which language data was collected and validated through crowdsourcing; and an in-built pedagogic toolkit (Y Tiwtiadur) developed in consultation with representatives of all anticipated academic and community user groups. The approaches used to construct the resources mentioned in this talk provide an invaluable template for those researching other minoritised languages. The specifics of how this template might inform resource development in these/such languages will be discussed further during the presentation.                                                                                  Bio: Dawn Knight is a Professor at the School of English; Communication and Philosophy and a member of the Centre for Language and Communication Research at Cardiff University. Her research focuses on corpus linguistics; discourse analysis and multimodality; and sits at the intersection of Linguistics and Digital Humanities. She has led on numerous projects in relation to Welsh language resource development; and was PI on the ‘CorCenCC: Corpws Cenedlaethol Cymraeg Cyfoes (The National Corpus of Contemporary Welsh): A community driven approach to linguistic corpus construction’ project. Funded by the ESRC and AHRC this £1.8 million inter-disciplinary and multi-institutional project led to the creation of a large-scale; open-source corpus of contemporary Welsh language.,,https://events.teams.microsoft.com/event/45b1aef7-51be-4b23-9d6c-9518d687d222@58f82789-6695-4f4a-abdb-357668d55cff

Drawing inspiration from work at UCREL Lancaster; the initial step involved compiling a representative and sufficiently large corpus of financial reports in Spanish. This type of resource was previously unavailable for Spanish; despite its widespread use. Today's presentation will explore the various stages involved in creating language resources within the financial sector; including corpora; datasets; terminologies; and tools that utilise machine learning and Transformers. Since 2022; our lab has contributed Spanish datasets to the shared tasks of the FNP workshops. We will specifically highlight FinCausal; a competition focused on detecting cause-effect relationships in paragraphs from financial reports. FinCausal 2023 was approached as an information extraction task; whereas FinCausal 2025 has been designed as a Question Answering (QA) task. The presentation will include an analysis of the characteristics of both Spanish and English datasets; along with an error analysis of the top-performing systems in both competitions.,,https://events.teams.microsoft.com/event/ed3a689f-afac-4b72-b423-13432cf66ca4@58f82789-6695-4f4a-abdb-357668d55cff
